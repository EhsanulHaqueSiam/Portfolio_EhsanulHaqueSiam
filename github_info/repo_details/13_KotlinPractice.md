# KotlinPractice

**GitHub:** https://github.com/EhsanulHaqueSiam/KotlinPractice  
**Language:** Kotlin (100%)

---

## Overview
A structured Kotlin learning repository covering fundamentals to advanced features like coroutines and delegation, organized in progressive practice modules.

---

## Repository Structure

| Module | Focus | Build System |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Practice1** | Core language features | Simple file-based |
| **Practice2** | Advanced Kotlin | Gradle (build.gradle.kts) |

---

## Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- Access modifiers, classes, interfaces
- Collections and aggregate operations
- Lambdas and higher-order functions
- Exception handling

### Advanced Features
- **Delegated Properties** - `by` keyword, ReadWriteProperty
- **Coroutines** - CoroutineScope, launch, Dispatchers
- **Generics** - Type parameters and constraints
- **Scope Functions** - with, let, apply, run, also

---

## Kotlin-Specific Skills

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Coroutines** | CoroutineScope, launch, Dispatchers, CoroutineExceptionHandler |
| **Delegation** | Property delegation with ReadWriteProperty |
| **Null Safety** | Proper nullable type handling |
| **Scope Functions** | Idiomatic use of with, let, apply |
