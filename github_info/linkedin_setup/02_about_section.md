## ✨ Option A: Narrative Style (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for:** Making a personal connection, showing your journey

```
I turn complex data into intelligent systems that make a real difference—from fine-tuning Medical BERTs for drug safety research to building ML pipelines that analyze 52,000+ user reviews with 90% accuracy.

As a Computer Science student at AIUB, I've always been driven by the question: "How can AI solve problems that actually matter?" That curiosity led me to publish research on Adverse Drug Reaction classification with Taylor & Francis (IDAA 2025), where I benchmarked domain-specific LLMs like BioBERT and PubMedBERT for healthcare applications.

But research is only part of my story. I love building things people can use. My Student Management System has earned 17 GitHub stars and 8 forks—making it one of the most starred student projects in my community. I've developed a complete Android curriculum with 54+ structured lessons, created a 7-source web scraping framework for news aggregation, and even built a 3-level OpenGL platformer game with my team that we demoed on YouTube.

What excites me most is the intersection of AI and real-world impact: designing normalized databases with 6-8ms query performance, training sentiment classifiers on large-scale datasets, and writing code that's clean enough to document and share with the open-source community.

Currently, I'm exploring opportunities in AI/ML Engineering, Backend Development, or Research roles where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to grow as a developer.

## 🎬 Option C: Conversational/Casual

**Best for:** Startups, creative companies, networking

```
Hey there! 👋

I'm Ehsanul—an AI developer who believes the best code tells a story about solving real problems.

Right now, I'm a CS student at AIUB who somehow ended up publishing research on Medical BERTs with Taylor & Francis, winning 1st Runner-Up at our CS Fest, and maintaining 26+ open-source projects (with 36+ stars from developers around the world).

My proudest builds? 🚀

📊 An NLP pipeline that analyzed 52,702 Spotify reviews with 85-90% accuracy
🎮 A 3-level Mario game in OpenGL that my team demoed on YouTube
📱 A 54-lesson Android curriculum I created while learning myself
🗄️ A database system so well-designed it loads in 6-8ms (even I was surprised)

What drives me: That moment when code stops being code and starts being something useful. Whether it's detecting adverse drug reactions in medical texts or helping students learn Android development—I want to build things that matter.

Currently exploring: AI/ML Engineering | Backend Development | Research opportunities
