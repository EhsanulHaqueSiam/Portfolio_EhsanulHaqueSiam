## 📝 Recommendation Request Templates

### Template 1: For Professors

**Subject:** LinkedIn Recommendation Request

```
Dear Professor [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to ask if you'd be willing to write a brief LinkedIn recommendation for me.

I really valued our work together in [Computer Graphics/Database class], particularly the [Mario game project/SMS project]. Since you witnessed my [technical skills/teamwork/dedication] firsthand, I believe your perspective would add meaningful credibility to my profile.

If you're comfortable, it would be helpful if you could mention:
• My technical contributions to [specific project]
• My ability to [lead teams/solve problems/meet deadlines]
• Any specific qualities you observed

I understand you're busy, so even a 2-3 sentence recommendation would be greatly appreciated. I'd be happy to share my LinkedIn profile or any project details if that would help.

Thank you for considering this!

Best regards,
Ehsanul Haque

Hey [Name]!

Hope you're doing well! I'm updating my LinkedIn profile and trying to build up my recommendations section.

Since we worked together on [Mario game/CS Fest app/research project], would you mind writing a short recommendation for me? It doesn't need to be long - even a few sentences about our collaboration would help.

If you could mention something about:
• How we worked together on [specific thing]
• Any technical or soft skills you noticed

I'd really appreciate it! Happy to return the favor if you want a recommendation too.

Thanks!

## 🎯 Sample Recommendation Text

Show recommenders what a good recommendation looks like:

### Example 1 (From Professor)
```
I had the pleasure of supervising Ehsanul during his Computer Graphics course where he led the development of a 2D platformer game. What impressed me most was his ability to coordinate a team of 5 students while also contributing significant technical work in OpenGL programming. The final project demonstrated both his coding skills and his leadership ability. He's the kind of student who not only understands the material but helps others understand it too.
```

### Example 2 (From Team Member)
```
Working with Ehsanul on our CS Fest project was a great experience. He took the lead on the Android development, implementing complex features like Firebase authentication and REST API integration. What stood out was his patience in explaining technical concepts to the team and his dedication to meeting our tight deadline. Our app won 1st Runner-Up, and Ehsanul's contributions were a big part of that success.
```

### Example 3 (From Classmate)
```
Ehsanul is one of the most helpful classmates I've had at AIUB. During our database course, he created detailed documentation for his Student Management System and shared it openly on GitHub. When I was struggling with normalization concepts, he took time to explain them clearly. His 17-starred GitHub project speaks to the quality of his work, but what I appreciate most is his willingness to help others learn.
