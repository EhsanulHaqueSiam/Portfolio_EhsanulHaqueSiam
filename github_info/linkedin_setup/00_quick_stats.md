## 💡 How to Use Metrics Effectively

### ✅ DO:
- Lead with numbers: "Built NLP classifier analyzing **52,702** reviews"
- Use specifics: "Achieved **85-90%** accuracy" not "high accuracy"
- Quantify impact: "**17 GitHub stars** and **8 forks**"
- Show scale: "Team of **5 developers**"
- Benchmark performance: "Query time reduced to **6-8ms**"

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use vague terms: "many", "several", "various"
- Round too much: say "52,702" not "50K+"
- Skip context: add what the number means
- Forget units: "6-8ms" not just "6-8"
